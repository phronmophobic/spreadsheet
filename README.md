## "Tutorial"

This isn't a real tutorial, but just enough info to do _something_ with the tool.

The toolbar buttons:  
`+` : add a new row of name, form, and value.  
`+42`: add a new row of name, number slider, and value.  
`+[]`: add a new row of name, ui editor, and value. The UI editor behavior is WIP and undocumented. Good luck!  
`+:)`: add a new row of name, custom component, and value. The first field is the name of a defui component and the second field is the initial value. Try `membrane.basic-components/counter` and `{:num 42}` and hit the `reset` button.  
`+!!`: adds a new row of name, form, and value. Most fields will eval when you type. This field will only reevalute when you hit the `go` button. Useful for side effects, long computations, or `require`s.

The checkbox will cause the form to `def` the value when it is reevaluated. The value doesn't def until the form is reevaluated. WARNING: if you type into the name field while the checkbox is checked, then it will def a new var for _every_ character you type.


The `edit` button let's you switch the namespace the forms are evaluated in. The `save` and `load` buttons are intended for saving/loading documents from a database, but are currently disabled.

## Hidden Features

### make-fn

You can do example based programming with `make-fn`. It's a special form of `(make-fn [cell1 cell2 cell3 ...] result-cell)`. The first arg is a list of arguments the function will take. The second argument is the value the function will return. Any intermediate cells required to derive `result-cell` from the inputs is automatically included.
