## "Tutorial"

This isn't a real tutorial, but just enough info to do _something_ with the tool.

The toolbar buttons:  
`+` : add a new row of name, form, and value.  
`+42`: add a new row of name, number slider, and value.  
`+[]`: add a new row of name, ui editor, and value. The UI editor behavior is WIP and undocumented. Good luck!  
`+:)`: add a new row of name, custom component, and value. The first field is the name of a defui component and the second field is the initial value. Try `membrane.basic-components/counter` and `{:num 42}` and hit the `reset` button.  
`+!!`: adds a new row of name, form, and value. Most fields will eval when you type. This field will only reevalute when you hit the `go` button. Useful for side effects, long computations, or `require`s.  


The `edit` button let's you switch the namespace the forms are evaluated in. The `save` and `load` buttons are intended for saving/loading documents from a database, but are currently disabled.
